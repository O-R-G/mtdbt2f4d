LETTER & SPIRIT

This is the story 
of the font you’re reading 
right *now.*
Its predecessor, 
called ‘MetaFont,’
was designed by professor 
Donald Knuth in 1979.
His software let users 
generate unlimited numbers 
of fonts by controlling 
a limited set of parameters.
MetaFont was created
to harness the essential 
‘intelligence’ of letterforms.
In Knuth’s view, the way 
a single letter is drawn –
an a priori ‘A,’ say
– presupposes and informs 
all the other letters 
in the same font. 
This information can be 
isolated, 
turned into a set of instructions, 
and put to work 
computer-automating 
the generation of new characters 
by filling in the features 
between two or more variables 
such as 
WEIGHT 
or 
SLANT.
Professor Knuth not only 
wrote the computer program,
he also wrote *about* 
his computer program 
in an article titled
‘The Concept of a Meta-Font’
published in the design journal
VISIBLE LANGUAGE
in 1981. 
*
Fellow Mathematician
Douglas Hofstadter 
read this article and responded 
with one of his own:
‘MetaFont, 
Metamathematics, 
and Metaphysics.’
While charmed by Knuth’s thesis, 
Hofstadter proceeds to dismantle 
his colleague’s claim 
that the shape of any letter 
is ‘mathematically containable.’
Hofstadter says,
‘Clearly there is much more 
going on in typefaces 
than meets the eye.
Underneath or behind 
each instance of “A”
there lurks a concept, 
a Platonic entity, 
a spirit.’
Hofstadter builds his argument 
on the distinction between
‘the letter of the law’
versus 
‘the spirit of the law.’ 
It’s a familiar premise 
that pits 
‘a set of set rules’
against 
‘a fluid set of principles.’
Our legal system is based on it –
judges work from precedent 
but also map uncharted territory 
by bringing the full range 
of their experience to bear 
on specific cases. 
In this way, 
the law *itself* evolves.
Similarly, 
Hofstadter suggests replacing 
Knuth’s ur-‘A’-FORM
with a yet-higher-level abstraction, 
an ur-‘A’-ESSENCE.
Hofstadter’s version extends 
beyond a Platonic shape, 
allowing for the concept of 
*what constitutes an A* 
to change, too.
He concludes:
‘Each instance of the “A” spirit 
reveals something new 
about the spirit 
without ever exhausting it.’
*
The history of typography 
is marked by a persistent 
drive to rationalize 
the shapes of letters.
Moveable metal type 
arrived in the 15th century,
its forms modeled on handwriting. 
Soon, 
more deliberately constructed 
alphabets appeared:
Fra Luca Pacioli’s letters 
of divine proportion (1509),
Geoffroy Tory’s humanistically
perfect forms (1529), 
and Albrecht Dürer’s set of 
mathematical instructions (1532).
But the first to apply 
these rational impulses 
to properly technical ends
was the Romain du Roi, 
or ‘King’s Roman.’
Commissioned by Louis XIV 
in the 17th century, 
these letters imposed a
mathematically-rigorous structure 
on forms that had, until now, 
developed organically.
Designed by
‘a royal committee of 
philosophers and technologists,’
the Romain du Roi was plotted 
on a 48 x 48 grid.
Each letter’s coordinates 
were then engraved, 
grid and letter
as a printed set of instructions, 
and cut into punches to make 
the finished metal type.
Other attempts followed:
Herbert Bayer’s 
Universal Alphabet (1925)
was a pared-down sans-serif font 
constructed from 
pure geometric elements.
The shapes of these letters 
mirror the tools 
that drew them –
ruler, 
T-Square, 
set square, 
compass, 
and protractor.
About the same time, 
Stanley Morison was busy 
redesigning the house typeface 
of London’s principal newspaper, 
THE TIMES. 
What became Times New Roman, 
was neither redrawn from scratch 
nor adjusted from existing fonts, 
but rather 
*amalgamated* 
from different typefaces 
made at various points 
over the previous 400 years.
Letterforms usually manifest
a designer’s aesthetic impulse 
at a given point in time, 
but Times New Roman 
was the bastard offspring 
of MANY designers 
working ACROSS time.
Finally, in 1957, 
French designer Adrian Frutiger 
took the rational mapping 
of the Romain du Roi 
to another plateau 
with his type, Univers.
Univers is an extended 
family of fonts where 
the standard palette of variants
(regular, italic, bold ...) 
was expanded seven-fold.
The family 
was conceptually housed 
in a two-dimensional matrix:
the X-axis 
marks WIDTH and POSITION
while the Y-axis 
charts WEIGHT. 
Individual fonts are 
named according to 
their position in the matrix –
55 for standard roman, 
56 for standard oblique, 
65 for medium roman, 
and so on.
*
The drive to rationalize 
eventually outgrew 
the letters themselves ...
In 1979, 
Donald Knuth described 
his preoccupation with designing 
meta-level instructions 
instead of individual letters,
as typical of a contemporary 
desire to view things
‘from the outside,
at a more abstract level,
with what we feel is 
a more mature understanding.’
From this elevated vantage, 
MetaFont was set up to oversee
not the specific letter shapes 
but rather 
‘how the letters would change 
in different circumstances.’
This font
(that you’re reading now)
picks up where Knuth’s left off. 
The only real difference
between the two
is that the new software 
which *generates* these letters 
and *is* these letters
was re-scripted to run 
on current computers. 
It is, more-or-less, 
the same as MetaFont, 
abiding the obvious fact 
that it swallows its predecessor. 
The result may look the same, 
but clearly it can’t be – 
in addition to the original code, 
the new version also embeds 
its ‘intellectual’ backstory.
Sure, 
it’s a tool to generate 
endless PostScript fonts, 
but it’s *at least equally* 
a tool to think 
around and about MetaFont, 
to chase after the 
intelligence of an alphabet, 
and ‘yield new insights into 
the elusive SPIRITS 
that flit about so tantalizingly, 
hidden just behind 
those lovely shapes 
we call LETTERS.’
*
How to keep things moving?
MetaFont 
was originally designed 
to generate 
an infinite number of fonts
by tweaking a few 
simple parameters
at different points in time.
But what if we make 
one of those parameters
*time* itself ?
...
Imagine a 3-dimensional space 
of possible values:
Run
WEIGHT
(a kind of bold)
along the X-axis, 
SLANT
(more or less italic)
up the Y, and extend 
SUPERNESS
(a kind of chutzpah) 
off into the Z beyond. 
A fourth parameter, 
PEN
is best conceived as 
a digital ‘nib’ that determines 
the letter’s 
fundamental shape and angle 
at any given point.
Now let’s send that point 
*constantly moving* 
through this imaginary cube. 
As it wanders randomly
it trails a script 
that renders an alphabet
which morphs according to 
its current position in the cube.
The result is something like
the potentially-endless matrix 
of Frutiger’s Univers, 
amalgamated over time like 
Morison’s Times New Roman, 
drawing itself like 
Bayer’s Geometric Alphabet, 
over the precise wireframe 
of Louis XIV’s Romain du Roi.
It all adds up to 
a typographic oxymoron: 
a SINGLE typeface 
that’s simultaneously 
MANY typefaces 
and never stops moving.
The result is this:

P.S.
The first small script
produced when learning 
a new programming language
writes two words 
that mark the border
between instruction & instance,
between code & product,
between spirit & letter.
Swaddled in asterisks 
and set without a full point,
this text always reads:
** Hello world **

LETTER & SPIRIT

This is the story
of the font you’re reading
right *now*.
It was designed 
by Dexter Sinister in 2012
and draws on 500 years
of thinking about the alphabet,
compressed here 
in three parts.
*
I. Font

The history of typography 
is marked by a persistent drive
to rationalize 
the shapes of letters.
Moveable metal type 
arrived in the 15th century,
its forms modeled on handwriting. 
More deliberately constructed alphabets
soon appeared –
letters of divine proportion,
humanist forms, 
or Albrecht Dürer’s mathematical instructions
from 1525:

But the first to apply 
such rational impulses 
to properly technical ends
was the Romain du Roi, 
or ‘King’s Roman’.
Commissioned by Louis XIV 
in the 17th century, 
these letters imposed
a mathematically-rigorous structure 
on forms that had, until now, 
developed organically.
Designed by
‘a royal committee
of philosophers and technologists’,
the Romain du Roi was plotted on a grid,
printed as a set of instructions, 

and cut into punches
to make metal type.
150 years later,
Herbert Bayer’s Universal Alphabet
was a pared-down sans-serif font 
whose letters mirror the tools 
that drew them:
ruler, 
T-square, 
set square, 
compass, 
and protractor.

About the same time, 
Stanley Morison was busy 
redesigning the house typeface 
of London’s principal newspaper, 
THE TIMES. 
What became Times New Roman, 
was neither redrawn from scratch 
nor adjusted from existing fonts, 
but rather *amalgamated* 
from a number of different typefaces 
made at various points 
over the previous half-millenium.

Letterforms are usually the product
of a single designer
at a given point in time, 
but Times New Roman 
was the bastard offspring 
of MANY designers 
working ACROSS time.
More recently, 
Adrian Frutiger’s Univers
took the rational mapping 
of the Romain du Roi 
to another plateau.
Univers is an extended family
whose standard variants
(regular, italic, bold ...) 
was expanded seven-fold.
The family 
was conceptually housed 
in a two-dimensional matrix:

the X-axis 
marks WIDTH and POSITION
while the Y-axis 
charts WEIGHT.
It could procreate in any direction, 
*ad infinitum*
and has,
growing from 21 to 63 types
before re-releasing as
Univers Next.
*
II. Metafont

In 1979,
Stanford professor Donald Knuth 
extended this idea of infinite extension
with his software, ‘Metafont’.
The computer program let users 
generate unlimited numbers 
of fonts by controlling 
a limited set of parameters.

Metafont was created
to harness the essential ‘intelligence’
of letterforms.
In Knuth’s view,
the way a single letter is drawn
(an a priori ‘A’, say)
presupposes and informs 
all the other letters 
in the same font. 
This information can be 
isolated, 
turned into a set of instructions, 
and put to work 
making the other letters
by filling in the features 
between a number of variables 
such as 
WEIGHT 
or 
SLANT.
Professor Knuth not only 
wrote the computer program,
he also wrote
*about* his computer program 
in the design journal
VISIBLE LANGUAGE.

Fellow Mathematician
Douglas Hofstadter 
read this article and responded 
with one of his own.
While charmed by Knuth’s thesis, 
Hofstadter proceeds to dismantle 
his colleague’s claim 
that the shape of any letter 
is ‘mathematically containable’.
Hofstadter says,
‘Clearly there is much more 
going on in typefaces 
than meets the eye.
Underneath or behind 
each instance of “A”

there lurks a concept, 
a Platonic entity, 
a spirit’.
Hofstadter builds his argument 
on the distinction between
‘the letter of the law’
versus 
‘the spirit of the law’. 
It’s a familiar premise 
that pits 
‘a set of set rules’
against 
‘a fluid set of principles’.
Our legal system is based on it –
judges work from precedent 
but also map uncharted territory 
by bringing the full range 
of their experience to bear 
on each specific case. 
In this way, 
the law *itself* evolves.
Similarly, 
Hofstadter suggests replacing 
Knuth’s ur-‘A’ FORM
with an even higher-level abstraction, 
an ur-‘A’ ESSENCE.
This ‘essence’ 
extends beyond a Platonic shape, 
allowing for the idea of 
*what constitutes an ‘A’* 
to change too.
He concludes:
‘Each instance of the “A” spirit 
reveals something new 
about the spirit 
without ever exhausting it’.
*
III. Meta-the-difference-between-the-two-font

Donald Knuth noted his preoccupation
with designing meta-level instructions 
instead of individual letters,
as typical of a contemporary inclination
to view things ‘from the outside,
at a more abstract level,
with what we feel is 
a more mature understanding’.
From this elevated vantage, 
Metafont was set up to oversee
not the specific letter shapes 
but rather 
‘how the letters would change 
in different circumstances’.
This font –
the one you’re reading right *now* –
picks up where Knuth’s left off. 
The only real difference between the two
is that the new software 
which *generates* these letters 
and *is* these letters
was re-scripted to run 
on contemporary computers. 
It is (more or less)
the same as Metafont, 
abiding the obvious fact 
that it swallows its predecessor. 
The result may *look* the same 
but clearly it can’t be
because in addition to the original code, 
the new version also embeds 
its ‘intellectual’ backstory.
Sure, 
it’s a tool to produce endless PostScript fonts, 
but it’s *at least equally* 
a tool to think 
around and about Metafont, 
to chase after
the intelligence of an alphabet, 
and ‘yield new insights into 
the elusive SPIRITS 
that flit about so tantalizingly, 
hidden just behind those lovely shapes
we call LETTERS.’
*
How to keep things moving?
Metafont was originally designed
to generate an infinite number of fonts
by tweaking a few simple parameters
at different points in time.
But what if we make 
one of those parameters
*time* itself ?
...
Imagine a 3-dimensional space 
of possible values:

Run
WEIGHT
(a kind of bold)	
along the X-axis, 
SLANT
(more or less italic)
up the Y, and 
SUPERNESS
(a kind of chutzpah) 
off into the Z beyond. 
A fourth parameter, 
PEN
is best thought of as a digital ‘nib’
that determines the stroke’s
shape and angle at any given point.
Now let’s send that point 
*constantly moving* 
through this imaginary cube. 

As it wanders randomly
it trails a script 
that renders an alphabet
which morphs according to 
its current position in the cube.
It all adds up
to a typographic oxymoron: 
a SINGLE typeface 
that’s simultaneously MANY typefaces 
and never stops moving.
The result is this:

P.S. 
The first small script
produced by a computer programmer
when learning a new language
writes two words that mark the border
between instruction & instance,
between code & product,
between spirit & letter.
Swaddled in asterisks 
and set without a full point,
this text reads:
** Hello, world **
